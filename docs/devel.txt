Development process
=================================

DBeaver CE sources can be checked out from https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver
There are a few other repositories (EE version, product installer, tools, DBeaver web site) which are not public.
These repositories are not required to build or work in CE version.

There are two main branches:
	- master (keeps recent stable version of DBeaver, usually result of merge with devel)
	- devel (where all current development happens)

Developers always commit/push in devel.
Pull requests should always be based on devel.

Other public branches could be created for some particular needs.
